# Analyzing-Sector-Affiliation-and-Leadership-Impact-on-Stock-Returns-through-Sentiment-Analysis

The goal of this task is to analyze the relationship between sentiment in news headlines and stock returns, and to investigate how changes in company leadership affect the correlation between stock returns of two companies. The task is divided into three main parts:

1. Sentiment Analysis:

Conduct sentiment analysis on two sets of news headlines (Text 1 for the IT sector and Text 2 for the Biopharma sector) to create sentiment score vectors (S1 and S2) for each day over a 70-day period.

2. Regression Analysis:

Use the sentiment score vectors (S1 and S2) to explain the returns for Company B by performing two separate regressions:
Regress B's returns on a constant and S1.
Regress B's returns on a constant and S2.
Report the coefficient estimates and the RÂ² values for each regression.
Infer whether Company B is affiliated with the IT sector or the Biopharma sector based on the regression results.

3. Correlation Analysis:

Calculate and report the full sample correlation of returns between Company A and Company B.
Calculate and report the correlation of returns between A and B during the periods when John was the CEO of A.
Calculate and report the correlation of returns between A and B during the periods when Susan was the CEO of A.
Draw conclusions about the sector affiliation (IT vs. Biopharma) of Company A following Susan's appointment as CEO based on changes in the correlation patterns.

By completing these tasks, we aim to:

Understand the impact of sentiment in news headlines on stock returns.
Determine the sector affiliation of Company B based on its stock return responses to sector-specific news.
Analyze how leadership changes affect the relationship between the stock returns of two companies, providing insights into sector characteristics and management impact.
